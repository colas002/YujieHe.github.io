## What is Coding Standards
Following coding standards can be one of the keys to having higher code quality and becoming a better programmer. I agree that some coding standards can actually help you learn programming languages. Everyone has their own coding habits, and coding standards can be thought of as a set of rules that specify the finer aspects of coding such as indentation, placement of parentheses, naming, and so on. It is like a convention that everyone will write code according to its rules, which plays a key role in keeping the code consistent and readable, making the code easier to understand and maintain, and programmers can focus more on the logic and function of the code, especially when you work with multiple programmers, you may need to program and debug with other programmers frequently. But different coding styles can cause you to waste a lot of time just reading code.

Coding standards also help you prevent many common small, hard to notice human errors, and even make your life a little easier in many cases, such as comment, a lot of times when there is a problem with the code you wrote you may need to go back to the code you wrote days ago, weeks ago, or even months ago to find the problem. However, you may have forgotten their meaning and function. At this time, by checking the comment, you can effectively and quickly recall the function you wrote before or what those lines of code were used for and what happened, and then continue your debug. When other programmers view your code, they can also quickly understand your code by looking at the comments.

## Impression About ESLint and IntelliJ
After a week of using ESLint and IntelliJ, I found them to be very useful tools. ESLint helped me quickly identify and modify code that didn't comply with certain rules, and even check for errors that I didn't notice, such as unused variables or functions, missing brackets, undefined variable names, etc. Makes my code look more regular, clean, and correct. And IntelliJ provides an environment to write code.

## Feeling About Green Checkmark
I think getting the green checkmark is very useful. green checkmark is a recognition that my code conforms to and follows the coding standards. It can help me reflect and make meaningful improvements during programming. Immediate feedback on code errors through yellow and red alerts allows me to find out what went wrong in the first place, manually fixing each error allows me to learn and avoid making the same mistake the next time, and creates habits that allow me to write high-quality and better code.

## Conclusion
Coding standards are a very useful tool in programming, bringing efficiency, reliability, and cleanliness to reading and writing code, playing a crucial role in software development, saving a lot of reading time, and providing a high-quality collaborative experience.
