<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Software engineering is a very dynamic and diverse field with an impact far beyond the realm of Web application development alone. Through this exciting journey, I came to understand the basic concepts of the software engineering backbone. These concepts find their relevance in countless development scenarios, transcending the boundaries of any single domain. In this article, I want to delve into three particularly fascinating areas: Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Design Patterns. The rich content in each of these areas has a broader impact than just Web application development.</p>

<h2 id="agile-project-management">Agile Project Management</h2>
<p>Agile project management is a flexible iterative software development method that emphasizes adaptability to changing requirements, collaborative efforts, and frequent delivery of small functional parts of the project. Just like we did in the final project, each function to be implemented or modified is divided into branches and finally merged into main. So each problem or task represents a specific problem or function.
While not limited to Web development, it can also be used in other software projects, such as in hardware development to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing and even in non-technical projects like event planning to help manage changing requirements and ensure the success of the event.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-management">Configuration Management</h2>

<p>Configuration management involves tracking and controlling changes in software, maintaining integrity and traceability throughout development, achieving the best possible state through constant adjustments, and is critical to consistency, quality, and compliance, understanding the impact of each change on the final product. For example, in a hospital updating a patient record system, configuration management can ensure that all changes are traceable, consistent, and compliant. Or manage 3D models, scripts and soundtracks in film and video game development to achieve consistency and coherence.</p>

<h2 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns</h2>

<p>Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design, efficient and reusable solutions to recurring design problems that have been repeatedly studied through practice and collective experience. Design patterns can also be used in a variety of programming environments, such as game development, to effectively manage a large number of similar objects, such as trees in a landscape, and to discuss common design problems and solutions in fields such as architecture and urban planning.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The breadth of software engineering extends far beyond the scope of Web application development, with many concepts applicable to a variety of technology areas, and understanding and applying these concepts can significantly improve the efficiency, quality, and adaptability of various projects.</p>
