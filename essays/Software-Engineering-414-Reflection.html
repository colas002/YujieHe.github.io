<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Reflecting on my experience in ICS 414 this semester, I would say it was a challenging but also rewarding journey. The important software engineering concepts and technologies, expanded my understanding of software engineering and laid a solid foundation for my future development projects. The ongoing code review and milestone meetings provided me and my group with timely feedback, helping us continuously improve our project and understand classic concepts such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, and configuration management. Integrating these practices into our project, helped me effectively build and become familiar with the software engineering workflow. The proficient use of technologies such as IntelliJ Idea, git, GitHub, Bootstrap 5, and Meteor, among others, enabled me to expand my toolkit and work efficiently in contemporary development environments. And understanding the value of user interface design for web applications was another valuable learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="customer-meeting">Customer Meeting</h2>
<p>The experience of communicating with customer was also an important learning experience, giving us the opportunity to combine theory with practice. In multiple meetings with customer, I learned a lot about how to correctly identify customer needs, convey technical information, and create feasible project plans. Through questioning and discussion, we expressed the goals and requirements of the project, not only helping us gain a clear understanding of customer needs but also teaching us how to regularly review milestones. These customer meetings allowed us to reflect on previous milestones, check whether we were on track, and adjust our development direction based on customer feedback. This communication style helped us respond flexibly to changes in customer needs.</p>

<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>I also had a great experience collaborating with my team members. Through cooperation and communication, we collectively achieved the goals of each project phase and learned how to effectively solve problems. clarified each member’s role and responsibilities, and assigned tasks based on individual skills and interests, promoting active participation from every member. Communication on Discord helped us stay synchronized and discuss any issues as they arose, our discussions included providing progress updates at each meeting, planning upcoming tasks, setting goals for each stage, etc. And when encountering technical challenges or other obstacles, we utilized our knowledge and skills to help each other by sharing best practices and solutions. We listened to each other’s ideas, respected different opinions, and reached a consensus through discussion. These experiences deeply reinforced my understanding of the importance of teamwork in software engineering projects.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>ICS 414 has greatly expanded my understanding of software engineering, especially in web application development. The lessons learned here will undoubtedly shape my approach to future software projects, including how to balance technical implementation with customer expectations, and teamwork in software engineering. drives me to continuously improve the project, ensuring high-quality and efficient code in every development stage.</p>
